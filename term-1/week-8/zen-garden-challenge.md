# Zen Garden Challenge

1. Follow the link to the CSS Zen Garden
http://www.csszengarden.com/

2. Click through the links on the right-hand side of the page to see how the same page has been styled in different ways.

3. Download the source HTML file.

4. Create your own styles for the content.

Note: Try not to change anything at all in the HTML file. Accomplish changes to the display of the content simply by providing styles.

...but if you really have to..cheat!
