# Flex Wrap Challenge

This is a good one!

1. Watch the clip.
2. Open *source.html*
3. Attempt to recreate the layout and flexibility you can see in the clip.

## Hints
* flex-wrap https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/f/flex-wrap/

## Finally

If your version works well at a fixed size (rather than being flexible), concentrate on improving the look at feel of the content by doing the following:

* Provide styles for fonts, size and color.
* Provide padding for content.
* Provide margins for containers.
* Provide header and footer elements.
* Provide an image of the artist.
* Apply a background image.
* Provide a link to the YouTube video for the song.
* Provide a list of links to YouTube videos of other songs by the same artist.
